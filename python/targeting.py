# Targeting Specs

## Testing with the targeting specs setting and reach estimate

***

This sample creates a targeting spec JSON string using the pop up composer.
Check the [targeting spec reference doc][1] for more information on targeting
specs. Using the composer in this sample, you can also test the targeting spec
with the [reach estimate][2] API end point to see if this is a valid targeting
setting and what is the estimated audience size.
