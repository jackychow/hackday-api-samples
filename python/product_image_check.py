# Product Image Size Check

## Check the image sizes of products in a product catalog.

***

This sample checks the product images of a catalog to see whether the images
are over 600x600px, the recommended size for dynamic ads.

* It checks products of an existing prodoct catalog at product catalog level. It
is not restricted to certain product feeds.
* You can use it to check all products of your catalog, by copying the code
below and remove the limit checking.
* It checks "additional images" of each product also, to see whether a simple
swapping is feasible.

        This class provides a function (`check_product_images`)
        to check product image sizes in a product catalog with Facebook
        Marketing API.

        It returns a tuple, with 3 number: total products checked, number of
        products with images of recommended size, number of products with images
        below recommended size but having at least 1 big enough additional
        image, as well as an array of up to 5 small image samples for the last
        case.

        Set the limit to a number in huandreds or a little more. Only
        products of that number would be checked. We have this control as
        to check multiple images of each product in a catalog with millions of
        products will take too long. But if you run this script on your own
        machine, you can raise that limit more.
