# Lead Ads

## Creating lead ads

***

This sample shows how to use the Marketing API to create a new lead ad. Lead Ads
allow advertisers a mechanism to capture leads using native Facebook products.
The ads open a form that prompt advertisers with custom qualifiers or to confirm
contact information. The data is then collected and sent back to the advertiser.
The most important part of the lead ad is the lead form. In this sample, you can
use the lead form UI component to input an existing lead form you created before
, or create a new one.

    The flow of creating a lead ad is similar to creation of other ads, except
    for the following special settings:

    * The campaign must have its `objective` set to `LEAD_GENERATION`
    * The campaign should have its `buying_type` set to `AUCTION`
    * The ad set must have its `promoted_object` set to the corresponding
    `<PAGE_ID>`
    * The ad set's `optimization_goal` must be set to `LEAD_GENERATION`
    * The ad set's `billing_event` should be set to `IMPRESSIONS`
    * The targeting for the ad set can be either `mobilefeed` or `desktopfeed`
