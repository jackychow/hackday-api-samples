## Creating custom audiences and uploading data

***

This sample shows how to use the Custom Audiences API to create a new custom
audience and upload data to it.

Using data from your CRM system, you can find your existing customers on
Facebook. You can then run campaigns to re-target those customers and/or
campaigns that target new customers and exclude existing ones.
