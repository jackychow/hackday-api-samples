# Creative Testing

## Creating ads with combination of creative elements

***

This sample shows how to create ads that use different combinations of
creative elements.
This is useful to test  multiple images, text, and landing pages and see
which performs best.
Suppose you have 1 link, 2 titles, 2 body, and 3 images, the result will
be 1 x 2 x 2 x 3 = 12 creatives in the result ad set. Instead of making 12
separate requests, the sample uses the batch API to send one request with all
12 creatives.

        There are 7 steps in this sample:

        1. Create a campaign

        3. Upload images
        4. Make combinations of specified creative elements
        5. Prepare an API batch
        6. For each creative combination, add a call to the batch to create a
        new ad
        7. Execute API batch

        Params:

        * `accountid` is your Facebook AdAccount id
        * `name` is a string of basename of your ads.
        * `page` is the Facebook page used to publish the ads
        * `titles` array of strings of what user will see as ad title
        * `bodies` array of strings of what user will see as ad body
        * `image_paths` array of image file paths
        * `targeting` is a JSON string specifying targeting info of your ad
          See [Targeting Specs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/targeting-specs)

        * `optimization_goal` the optimization goal for the adsets
        * `billing_event` what you want to pay for
        * `bid_amount` how much you want to pay per billing event
        * `daily_budget` is integer number in your currency. E.g., if your
           currency is USD, dailybudget=1000 says your budget is 1000 USD
        * `lifetime_budget` lifetime budget for created ads
