# Mobile App Custom Audiences

## Creating custom audiences based on frequency of mobile app events

***

This sample shows how to use the Custom Audiences API to create a custom
audience based on frequency of mobile app events. You can create MACAs quite
easily via the native tools like ads manager or power editor, this sample will
demonstrate how to create ones based on the frequency of app events for example
how many times the user opened the app or made purchases, which is only possible
through the API at the moment.
